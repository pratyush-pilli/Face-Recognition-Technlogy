# Face Recognition Technology

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a **Face Recognition System** using OpenCV and Deep Learning. It detects and identifies faces in images and videos using advanced machine learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** OpenCV, NumPy, dlib, face_recognition
- **Model:** Deep Learning-based Face Recognition (using dlib's ResNet model)

## 📥 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pratyush-pilli/Face-Recognition-Technlogy.git
   cd Face-Recognition-Technlogy
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Project:**
   ```sh
   python face_recognition.py
   ```

## 📌 Features
✅ Detects faces in images and live video streams  
✅ Recognizes and labels known faces  
✅ Supports real-time face recognition with a webcam  
✅ Uses deep learning for high accuracy  
✅ Scalable for large datasets of faces  
✅ Registering new faces via interface

## 🖼️ Usage Guide
- Place known face images inside the `known_faces/` directory.
- Run the script to start detecting and recognizing faces.
- Modify `face_recognition.py` to add more advanced features.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve accuracy with a custom-trained model  
🔹 Deploy as a web API using Flask/FastAPI  
🔹 Integrate a front-end UI using Streamlit  
🔹 Optimize performance with GPU acceleration
